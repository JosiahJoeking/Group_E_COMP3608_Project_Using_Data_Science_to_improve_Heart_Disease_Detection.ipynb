# Cardiovascular Disease Risk Prediction

Cardiovascular Disease remains one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide, with approximately 17.9 million people succumbing to CVDs in 2019 alone, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). This repository addresses the urgent need for effective risk assessment and prevention strategies for cardiovascular diseases by harnessing the power of machine learning.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for assessing an individual's risk of cardiovascular disease based on their health data and lifestyle choices. Traditional methods for diagnosis and risk assessment of CVDs by human doctors are prone to errors. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and multiple health datasets, this project aims to extract meaningful correlations and create a robust classifier utilizing health information and lifestyle choices such as alcohol consumption and smoking.

## Methodology
The project employs various machine learning techniques to build and evaluate predictive models. The focus is on maximizing the F1 score in three traditional prediction algorithms, namely Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. Additionally, feature importance analysis is conducted to identify the most impactful features contributing to the prediction of cardiovascular disease risk.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains a comprehensive collection of health data and lifestyle choices of individuals, including information such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, and more. The datasets arr sourced from Kaggle.

## Impact
Developing an accurate predictive model for cardiovascular disease risk assessment has the potential to revolutionize preventative medicine. By providing patients and their doctors with actionable insights into their risk, this tool can significantly reduce the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. The ultimate aim is to raise awareness and mitigate the risk of CVD in Trinidad and Tobago, contributing to improved public health outcomes.
